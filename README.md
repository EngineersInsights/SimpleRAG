# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Python, ChainLit, Hugging Face, and OLLAMA. RAG enhances the capabilities of generative language models by integrating retrieval-based methods to provide more contextually relevant responses.

## Overview

RAG combines retrieval-based techniques with generative language models to improve response quality by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge source before generating responses. This implementation leverages ChainLit for handling chains of inference, Hugging Face for pre-trained language models, and OLLAMA for accessing external knowledge sources.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ChainLit (installation instructions [here](https://chainlit.org/))
- Hugging Face Transformers (installation instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html))
- OLLAMA (installation instructions [here](https://github.com/example/ollama))

1. Clone this repository and change directory:
```
https://github.com/EngineersInsights/SimpleRAG.git
cd SimpleRAG
```

2. Install dependencies
```
pipenv shell
pipenv install 
```
3. Run the code:
```
python dev_runner.py
